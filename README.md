# README.md

After cloning, initialize submodules with `git submodule update --init`.

Build the latest JSON and commit it with `./create_dashboard.sh`. This requires some setup, so run through the manual instructions below first to validate that everything is working.

# Manual Instructions

1. Build the latest dashboard.json with the data-parser (pre-built jar in directory)
2. Commit the newly created dashboard.json in simra-project.github.io

Additional tips can be found in the README.md of data-parser and simra-project.github.io
